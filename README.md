## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

This project was fun I would say. Manipulation of images to match designs was challenging and had to come up with solution that both works, and it's not overcomplicated. That definitely was a good lesson. Another thing is that I decided to do this only using HTML and CSS and semantic tags. *Details* and *Summary* tags it's not something I see often on websites, so I thought it will be a good choice in this particular project. Of course because it's HTML and CSS only I had to use small trick with radio inputs to be able to open and close box as an accordion.

### Continued development

In the future projects I want to focus on using more semantic elements. HTML offers a lot of interesting tags, but I don't see them very often on pages or applications.
